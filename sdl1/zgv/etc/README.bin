README.bin - Information about binaries
---------------------------------------

The zgv binary here is linked against these shared libraries:

- libc.so.6 and libm.so.6	(glibc 2.2.5)
- libvga and libvgagl.so.1	(svgalib 1.4.3)
- libjpeg.so.62			(libjpeg 6b)
- libpng.so.2			(libpng 1.0.12)
- libz.so.1			(zlib 1.1.4)
- libtiff.so.3			(libtiff 3.5.5)

You need all these libraries (though not necessarily these exact
versions) installed to use this binary - your distribution should come
with most of them, though you may need a newer version of svgalib (if
so, look on http://www.svgalib.org/ for that).

You need to install the zgv binaries as root. The easiest way is to
(as root) type `make'.

While the info files and man page generated from zgv's texinfo manual
are included in the binary distribution, the texinfo file itself
isn't, to save space. If you want that (to make a printed manual, for
example), you'll need to get hold of the source distribution.

If zgv is distributed as binaries only - although the source is
available, it's quite possible you will have downloaded only the
binaries - then this message is required:

This program is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
Group.

...which is perfectly reasonable, because it is. (Actually, I'm not so
sure this is required now it's using a shared library version, but
what the heck. :-))


Have fun!

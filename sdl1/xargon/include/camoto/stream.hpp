/// Truncate function callback (to truncate a stream::output)
/**
 * This function is called with a single integer parameter when a stream
 * needs to be shrunk or enlarged to the given size.
 *
 * Since no other data can be passed with this function call, usually
 * boost::bind is used to create a "wrapping" around some other function with
 * more parameters.
 *
 * The function signature is:
 * @code
 * void fnTruncate(stream::pos new_length);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This example uses boost::bind to package up a call to the Linux
 * truncate() function (which requires both a filename and size) such that
 * the filename is supplied in advance and not required when the \e fn_truncate
 * call is made.
 *
 * @code
 * fn_truncate fnTruncate = boost::bind<void>(truncate, "graphics.dat", _1);
 * // later...
 * fnTruncate(123);  // calls truncate("graphics.dat", 123)
 * @endcode
 *
 * Normally this callback function only needs to be used when specialised
 * streams are in use.  For example when creating a writable substream around
 * another stream, you will need to supply a callback to handle the substream
 * having enough data written into it that it needs to be enlarged.  In this
 * case presumably you will move the data in the parent stream to make room
 * for the now larger substream.
 *
 * The callback should throw stream::write_error if the operation did not
 * succeed.

libgamemusic provides a standard interface to access different music file
formats.

\section libgamemusic_structure Structure

The main interface to the library is the getManager() function, which returns
an instance of the Manager class.  The Manager is used to query supported
music formats, and for each supported file format it returns an instance of
the FormatType class.

The FormatType class can be used to examine files and check what file format
they are in, and if they are in the correct format, to open them.  Successfully
opening a music file produces an instance of the Music class.  The MusicType
class can also be used to create new music files from scratch, which will again
return a Music instance.

Reading and writing files through the Music class is done with lists of
"events", such as note-on and note-off.  These events are transparently
converted to and from the underlying file format by the Music class.

\section libgamemusic_example Examples

The libgamemusic distribution comes with example code in the form of the
<a href="http://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemusic/blob/master/examples/gamemus.cpp">gamemus
utility</a>, which provides a simple command-line interface to the
full functionality of the library.

For a small "hello world" example, try this:

@include hello.cpp

When run, this program produces output similar to the following:

@verbatim
There are 13 instruments in this song.
This song is called: Jill of the Jungle - Funky
@endverbatim

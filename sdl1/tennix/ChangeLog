    Streamline the archive loading mechanism
    
    Only load the archive once (in the main function)
    and pass a reference to the archive object to the
    initialization functions for graphics, sound and
    input (which will read the data from the archive).

    Don't send input events when nothing has changed
    
    This should save bandwidth and speed up on slow links
    and machines. Might introduce some bugs when the UDP
    packet sent isn't received. Does not matter so much,
    because input data often changes, which will lead to
    a new packet to be sent.

    Apply fixes and documentation notes for Windows builds
    
    Back in February when I was building Tennix on Win32,
    there have been some changes (to get Tennix to compile
    under mingw32) that have not yet been re-integrated.
    
    This patch fixes the DLLINTERFACE issues on Win32. It
    also describes some library linking notes in README.win32.

    Only use one sending socket; auto-determine ports
    
    For sending UDP packets, we only need one socket to be
    open - both types of packets (input and state) can be
    sent through the same socket.
    
    Simplify the configuration of multi-player by setting
    the pre-defined ports based on which machine is the
    master and which one is the slave. This way, we only
    have to specify for each instance the type (slave or
    master) and the hostname/ip of the opponent.

    and add the necessary libraries to get Tennix with SDL_net
    working on Mac OS X.

    This allows us to strictly split the per-process data from
    the real "status" data in the game :)

    Do not hardcode Python version to 2.5 (allow 2.6)
    
    Now that distros start shipping Python 2.6 as their
    default Python versions, we do not depend directly
    on Python 2.5, but leave it up to the system to provide
    a suitable version of Python.

    Save the current gamestate in a file and re-load it

    We're missing some input sanitizing here, but the
    worst case is that Tennix won't start, in which case
    the user simply has to remove the gamestate file.

    with the "racket cursor". We fix this here by providing

    Enable more compiler warnings, fix most warnings
    
    As a result of the recent "return" bug, I've enabled
    some more compiler warnings and fixed most of them
    by altering the source code, which should make the
    codebase more robust and less prone to error :)

    Fix a severe bug on non-x86 machines (archive segfault)
    
    Somehow, I missed the "return" statement and the compiler
    did not complain. That's the reason why the archiver did
    not work on 64-bit machines and produced wrong results in
    Scratchbox's emulated armel environment.

    New physics and scoring system (AI partially broken)
    
    Changes from February 2nd, with some clean-ups today.
    
    New physics and scoring system that has more "fault"
    possibilities, like hitting the net, multiple bounces
    of the ball, etc..
    
    Based on the new physics, a more advanced scoring
    system has also been introduced that can handle the
    new events that result in a score.
    
    The serving has been fixed - now the serving does not
    change for every score, but on a per-game basis.
    
    Smash and topspin are new and can be played by P1
    with e (topspin) and f (smash). The physical properties
    of these still have to be optimized.
    
    The new changes break the AI, and the AI now is very
    dumb again. We need to work on a improved AI that takes
    advantages of the new information available via the
    physics engine.
    
    Some old, unused variables have been removed.

    last "position" of the referee and if it has changed,
    redraw the back buffer. This saves a lot of painting.

    Make sure FPS limit in the main menu is always correct
    
    Without this patch, after the gameloop has finished, we
    won't have reset the FPS counter, so the FPS limiter
    will be practically disabled, depending on how long you
    played.
    
    With this patch, the FPS limit counter is reset after
    the gameloop has finished, so we always have a correct
    way of calculating FPS. This can probably be improved.

    to shift the repeated image on the start for a moving effect.

    Fix problems with mouse control (lock the mouse if
    we are using the keyboard). This makes the mouse
    control work nicely together with the keyboard control,
    so we enable mouse control by default now.
    
    Draw a mouse rectangle on the screen so the user knows
    what's going on when using mouse control. This should
    make playing Tennix a bit easier with the mouse, because
    the racket is always sloppy (you can move the mouse faster
    than you can move the racket.

    From the mail:
    if I understood correctly, the position of the ball is
    updated, then the keyboard events are read, then the
    screen is redisplayed. It should be instead: the screen
    is redisplayed, then keyboard events are read and handled,
    then the ball position is updated: that way the keyboard
    event is connected with what is on the screen, which is
    what the player would expect.

    Improve mouse input to work alongside keyboard input
    and change the way mouse input works (press and hold
    to move the racket, release to swing the racket).
    
    Initialize the "Player" structs in game.c correctly,
    so we don't get compile warnings and so that our
    variables for each player are initialized sanely.

    Remove the -g debug flag from the CFLAGS and make
    the version 0.5.0 again (instead of 0.5.0+git).

    Add FPS limiting code; fix touchpad movement
    
    Add code to limit rendering to 33 FPS (should make the
    CPU a bit happier, after all); this can be disabled.
    
    Fix touchpad movement to be more exact in input_human.
    
    Remove the obsolete BALL_DEFAULT_SPEED define in game.h

    Faster graphics; touchscreen support
    
    Make graphics more faster by only updating the
    parts of the UI that have to be redrawn (this
    could still be optimized, but works well so far).
    
    Add support for mouse/touchscreen. The mouse and
    touchscreen support will not be enabled in Desktop
    builds but will be enabled for handheld devices
    like the Nokia Internet Tablets.

    Added TODO list and new side menu draft
    
    Added list of TODO items that has accumulated over
    the last few weeks (photos, sounds and music).
    
    Added new side menu that I've created yesterday
    evening. It's still not finished, but a future Tennix
    release should probably have its menu to look something
    like this draft (tennix-side-menu.xcf).

    but replace it with the correct tennix version when building
    the "Tennix.app" Mac OS X application.

    Support for BINARY_INSTALL_DIR, Makefile updates
    
    After a suggestion by a package maintainer, the makefile
    now supports the "BINARY_INSTALL_DIR" variable which can
    be used to specify an alternative install dir for Unix-like
    systems. This can be used to install the "tennix" binary in
    /usr/games on Debian-based systems.
    
    The makefile has been updated to more directly remove some
    files in the clean target, so all temporary files get removed.

    Joystick support (via command line); better keyboard controls
    
    Enable more keyboard controls for Player 1 (arrow keys, space,
    left control) and enable the usage of a joystick when the user
    specifies the name of the joystick as command line argument.
    
    This even works with applesmc on Linux, so you can play and
    control Tennix by tilting your Apple MacBook and pressing the
    left control key, which is now mapped to Player 1 swing racket.

    Sound rework, background music, image_id/sound_id
    
    Rework the sound system to strip sound playing from the
    game logic and move it into the "display"/"render" code.
    
    Add free background music to menu from MelodyLoops.
    Convert sound samples to OGG Vorbis to save space.
    Sound panning (left, right) for the "racket hit" sound.
    
    Use image_id/sound_id for the numeric identifier of
    resources to make the headers a bit more understandable.

    select if she wants to run tennix in fullscreen or not.
    
    Add a resource file for the dialog box layout and the
    Win32-specific icon (our executable now has an icon!).
    
    New .iss installer script (InnoSetup) that will compile
    a standalone exe installer from the tennix binaries.

    The computer AI now has a slightly better move
    algorithm to "catch" the ball.
    
    A simple ngram-based ball position predictor has
    been added, so the computer AI can move based on
    previous ball movements to have a better chance
    of catching the ball.

    GameState of the match has set the "is_over" flag.
    
    When loading graphic resources, use black color key
    for font images to support opacity-based blitting.
    
    Add font_draw_string_alpha() to draw fonts w/ opacity
    and add font_draw_string() macro (opacity=255).
    
    Add a neat, opacity-based text scroller to the main
    menu and provide input help text (keyboard controls).

    Re-work court graphic to support different court textures
    and convert grass texture from old court + add new textures:
     - Clay (red/orange-ish) and
     - Hard (concrete-looking grey)
    
    Don't call SDL_SetColorKey() for loaded images anymore, because
    we're now using RGBA PNG files instead of "black-is-alpha" BMPs.
    
    Removed introimage() function as it's not used anywhere.

    Don't allow the player to hit the ball with the racket when
    an "out" state has been reached. The ball will fly-by the
    racket even with the racket swung at the time of impact.
    
    Disallow keeping the "swing racket" button permanently
    pressed, but add a lock to disallow re-swinging the rack when
    the corresponding key has not been released yet.

    data2csrc determines variable names, shell compatibility
    
    João Pinto pointed out that Tennix will not compile when
    not using bash as /bin/sh, as the makefile in data/ will
    complain about bad substitution.
    
    This has been worked around by making data2csrc generating
    the variable name on-the-fly if the variable name is not
    passed as second command line argument.

    and removed some obsolete files in the data folder.
    
    Make in-game ball rotation faster to fit better to
    the new-style ball graphic.
    
    Make right-mouse button act as color switcher in main
    menu (currently this is just a visual gimmick..).

    Resources in binary support, button drawing functions
    
    Added support for converting data files to c source, which
    will then be included and compiled into the binary. This
    makes Tennix run without the "data" folder, and the game
    resources (sounds and data) cannot simply be edited for the
    binary distribution.
    
    Added first cut of button drawing routines which can be
    useful for menu navigation later on. (including text)
    
    Fix space character in Smallish font.

    Font improvements, faded lines, simplified menu+quitting
    
    In-game scores are now displayed using the fond code, the
    "score.png" graphic and show_digit() function got removed.
    
    Add dkc2 font, and improve font and graphics code (image
    width, image height, sprite width, simplified char search.
    
    New draw_line_faded() method that draws a line with faded
    colors, fixed old draw_line() code and make draw_line() a
    macro that calls draw_line_faded().
    
    Add support for quitting tennix by closing the tennix window.
    
    Elektrons beatified, added faded line drawing. Move around
    items in the menu, remove sound + racket animation.
    
    Fade to black the menu when quitting.
    
    Clean-up stuff in tennix.h.

    Fix animations to be more smooth in font_draw_string()
    and rename to BUNGEE and PENDULUM (that's what they

    Make the "release-osx" target create a zipfile that is
    named "tennix-x.y.z-macosx.zip" (added "-macosx").

    This is Tennix 0.3.3, adding the first version of our dynamic
    text engine, which enables us drawing animated bit-mapped fonts
    to the screen. Currently used in menus and as gameplay status.
    
    This also disables loading the custom icon (SDL_WM_SetIcon)
    when Tennix is ran on Mac OS X, as Tennix on OS X already has a
    beatiful icon and OS X doesn't display per-window icons.

    Improve AI player movement to make the game livelier :)
    
    Fade between two scores and block input (both human and
    AI input) while the scene is being faded to add a smooth
    crossfade between scores. Don't wait for keypresses as
    before.

    playing tennix.
    
    The single-player (AI) mode is activated with the hi-
    scores menu item currently. Still no difficulty settings.

    Fix ball direction gameplay bug
    
    This commit fixes a small bug that appeared while testing
    the game - ball direction sometimes was inversed, resulting
    in the ball to go into the wrong direction.

    Added tennis ball and its shadow to 3D test
    
    Added a yellow circle and a gray shadow to the
    Tennix pygame 3D-rendering test. The shadow size
    changes depending on the ball height (z) and both
    ball and shadow size decrease when the ball moves
    away from the observer.

    Bugfix for ball not moving completely off-screen
    
    This fix makes the game only stop when the ball is
    completely off-screen, so it doesn't look like the
    ball was stopped at the edge of the screen.

    Compile-time debug mode, get_move_y gameplay fixes
    
    Added compile-time DEBUG variable to enable or disable
    debugging code (currently position visualisation) and
    added dest1/dest2 variables to the Ball struct.
    
    Fix return value and handling in get_move_y() to have
    smoother gameplay and better ball movement control.

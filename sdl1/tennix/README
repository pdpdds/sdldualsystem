ABOUT
=====

   This is the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) port of Tennix!, a 
   game written by Thomas Perl in 2003. This version has been up-
   scaled to a resolution of 640x480 in comparison to the 320x200 
   format used in the original game.

   Changes from the original Tennix to the first SDL release include
   a new shadow, advanced alpha blending and the removal of the 
   previously-included pseudo-advertisements.

   For all changes, please see the ChangeLog file.

   This port has been written on the 10th of May 2007 and is now 
   being improved and updated since then.


INSTALLATION AND BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

   To build tennix, simply run "make" (on Unix-like systems) or 
   follow the instructions for your platform in the README.* files.
   Be sure to install all the dependencies listed below and check out the
   makefile for instructions on what you can enable/disable with the help
   of environment variables (e.g. USE_PYTHON, NONFREE_LOCATIONS, DEBUG, ...)

   Tennix is known to build on Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, Ubuntu 8.10, Windows XP
   and Windows Vista (using MSYS/mingw32 - see README.win32), Mac OS X 10.4
   and Mac OS X 10.5 (using XCode Tools - see README.MacOSX), the Maemo 4.0
   and Maemo 4.1 SDKs (Chinook/Diablo - see README.Maemo).

   Dependencies:
     · SDL       >= 1.2.13 (www.libsdl.org)
     · SDL_image >= 1.2.6  (www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image)
     · SDL_mixer >= 1.2.8  (www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer)
     · SDL_ttf   >= 2.0.9  (www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf)
     · SDL_net   >= 1.2.7  (www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net)

   (Tennix might compile and work with earlier versions of the respective
   libraries, but the versions here have been the ones that I've tested it
   with, so if there are problems, try to use the versions specified here)

   Optional dependencies:
     · Python    >=  2.5.x  (www.python.org)
       => If you don't want to use the Python integration, set the variable
          USE_PYTHON to a value other than 1 by specifying it on the "make"
          command line like this:      make USE_PYTHON=0

   On a Debian-based system, you can get all dependencies with the following
   command line:

    aptitude install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \
                     libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsdl-net1.2-dev python-dev


PLAYING TENNIX
==============

   You can play in either single-player or multi-player mode. You can even
   let two AI players play against each other. This can be configured in
   the controls screen.

   THE POWERBAR

   You have to keep your "hit" key pressed, so that your powerbar (on the
   bottom of the screen) "fills up". The more power you have, the stronger
   you will hit the ball (and the higher and longer it will fly). Too much
   power could make the ball go into the OUT, so be sure to use it wisely.

   CONTROLS

   Select the controller you like from the input selection menu. Be sure
   to connect gamepads and joysticks BEFORE starting Tennix, so they are
   enumerated and detected correctly.

   FUNCTION KEYS

   F  .... Toggle fullscreen (X11 only)
   P  .... Pause game


NETWORK MULTIPLAYER
===================

   This is done using two computers, the first is the faster one and the second
   one is the slower one. If both computers are equally powerful, just chose
   the faster one randomly.

   On the faster computer, use:
     ./tennix -m REMOTEHOST

   On the slower computer, use:
     ./tennix -s REMOTEHOST

   So, if your faster computer is called "fast.lan" and the slower computer is
   called "slow.lan", you could use the following setup:

     user@fast:~$ ./tennix -m slow.lan
     user@slow:~$ ./tennix -s fast.lan

   You have to configure each opponent in the input device selection screen
   using "Network player" as input device. Make sure that you do the reverse
   on the opposite computer.


DEVELOPMENT/DEBUGGING
=====================

   If you want to compile a debugging version of "tennix", you
   have to set the environment variable "DEBUG" to "1", either by
   using "DEBUG=1 make" or exporting the environment variable for
   the current session, as in "export DEBUG=1" followed by "make".

   See the HACKING and TODO files for more development information.
